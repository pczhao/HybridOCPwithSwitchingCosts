# HybridOCPwithSwitchingCosts
MATLAB code for solving hybrid optimal control problems with switching costs and free initial condition using occupation measures.

Requires SPOTless (found at <https://github.com/spot-toolbox/spotless>) and MOSEK (found at <https://www.mosek.com>).

To run the examples, run the run_*.m file.

To perform control synthesis, replace the spotsosprog.m file (located at spotless/spotopt/@spotsosprog) with the one provided (hybridOCP/src/tools/spotsosprog_changes.m). Or, make the following chages in the spotsosprog.m file by hand:
* Line 413: 
old: sol = minimize(pr,varargin)
new: [sol, y, basis, dual_multiplier] = minimize(pr,varargin)
* save all of the eqMultFac values in an array (look at lines 449, 454, 464, 471, 478 in the included spotsosprog_changes.m)
* Lines 84-92:  buildSOSDecompPrimal function
comment out lines 84-92
